link to the Deployed application: Node Application

Description of what the application does: Gives the user the option to create cards and add details to them making Emplyee cards which will then be pushed to HTML and displayed. Unfortunately due to some time constraints I am turning in a mostly complete version of the app, thanks.

Mostly all JS is complete, inquirer and jest packages were installed, and HTML Cards dont have HTML.
